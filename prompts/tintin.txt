The surface of the moon with a red-and-white checkered rocket landed in a large lunar plain.
The earth rises on the horizon.
Next to the rocket, a young man, Tintin, in an orange, bulky spacesuit with a bubble helmet stands on the surface,
He as copper hair with a single lock standing up in front.
Beside him, a small white dog in an orange dog spacesuit with a bubble helmet.
Draw in belgo-francian ligne claire style.
